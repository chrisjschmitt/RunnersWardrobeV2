## Remaining Gaps

The remaining items without info are mostly:
1. **"None" options** - No info needed (e.g., "None" for gloves means no gloves)
2. **Combo items** - Items like "Sunglasses + poles" that combine two things
3. **Sandals** - Walking footwear (could add if needed)

These gaps are acceptable as they either don't need explanation or are combinations of items that already have individual info.
